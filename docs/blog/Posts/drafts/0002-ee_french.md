## Overview
[TOC]
## Introduction to Express Entry System
[Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry) is an online system that we use to manage immigration applications from skilled workers. In the following contents, we will use `EE Entry` to refer to Express Entry System.
### Prerequisites
Given the fact that EE Enrty is a point-based system, with different categories and pools, it's important to know the prerequisites for each category and pool, as well as the general points for each category and pool in recent cases. We will give a brief introduction to the eligibility of French-language proficiency Category in this section, for more detailed information, please refer to [EE Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply.html#programs).

Express Entry has two types of categories with distinct functions:

1. **Immigration Programs**: Determine eligibility for different target groups
2. **Current Categories**: Provide additional points to accelerate applications

To apply, first verify your eligibility under one of the Immigration Programs, then explore Current Categories to maximize your points.

#### Eligibility for EE Entry and three `Immigration programs`
Currently, according to the [Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry), there are three `Immigration programs` in EE Entry:
- Canadian Experience Class
- Federal Skilled Worker Program
- Federal Skilled Trades Program

All of them have different eligibility requirements. People should choose the program that they are eligible for to get in the pool first.

========TODO: Add the eligibility for Canadian Experience Class========

#### CRS Points System and `Current categories`
After you have already checked the `Immigration programs` and you are eligible for the program, you should check the `Current categories` to see how can you accelerate your application in EE Entry in this system. Currently, there are 6 `Current categories` in EE Entry:
1. French-language proficiency
2. Healthcare and social services occupations
3. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) occupations
4. Trade occupations
5. Agriculture and agri-food occupations
6. Education occupations

And we will only talk about the `French-language proficiency` category in this section.

##### French-language proficiency Category Eligibility
1. ***meet the minimum criteria for Express Entry***, including being eligible for 1 of the 3 immigration programs it covers
2. ***have French-language test results*** that show a minimum score of 7 in all 4 language abilities on the Niveaux de compÃ©tence linguistique canadiens 
3. ***meet all of the requirements*** in the instructions for that round

> The information in this section is based on the information in the [***Important Reference: French-language proficiency Category Eligibility***](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/rounds-invitations/category-based-selection.html). Please refer to the reference for up-to-date and accurate information.

## Introduction to PTE Core
I believe people may vary familiar with the English language test like IELTS and CEPIP. Here we are going to introduce another English language test called PTE Core, which is relatively easy to prepare as an exam.
