This guide explains how to pass TCF Canada and obtain permanent residence (PR) in Canada through Express Entry as a French beginner. We will begin with an overview of the Express Entry system, with a focus on the <span style="color: red;">**French-language proficiency**</span> category. Then we’ll introduce TCF Canada, the French test accepted for immigration purposes. Finally, we will share a study plan for both TCF Canada and PTE Core to accelerate your Express Entry application.

## Overview
[TOC]

## Introduction to Express Entry System
[Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry) is the Canadian government’s online system for managing skilled worker immigration. In this guide, we will use `EE Entry` to refer to the Express Entry system.

EE Entry is a point-based system with different immigration programs and selection categories. Understanding both is critical to maximizing your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. In this section, we briefly introduce the Canadian Experience Class and the French-language proficiency category. For more details, see [EE Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply.html#programs).

There are two main structural components of EE Entry:

1. <span style="color: red;">**Immigration Programs**</span>: Determine your eligibility to enter the EE pool.
2. <span style="color: red;">**Current Categories**</span>: Award additional points in targeted rounds.

To begin, you must first qualify for one of the immigration programs, then explore categories to boost your score.

### Eligibility for EE Entry and the Three `Immigration programs`
According to the [official website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry), EE Entry includes three immigration programs:

1. Canadian Experience Class
2. Federal Skilled Worker Program
3. Federal Skilled Trades Program

Each program has distinct eligibility requirements. Applicants must first identify the one they qualify for to enter the EE pool.<br><br>

We’ll focus on the [Canadian Experience Class](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply/canadian-experience-class.html):

- Work experience must fall under NOC categories: <span style="color: red;">**TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3**</span>  
    - You may have experience across multiple NOCs.  
    - See explanation in the [Eligibility of Canadian Experience Class](#explanation-of-the-eligibility-of-canadian-experience-class) section.
- Experience must be **gained in Canada** under valid temporary resident status.  
    - Remote work counts only if physically in Canada and employed by a Canadian employer.
- You must show that you performed:  
    - the lead statement in the NOC job description  
    - most of the main duties
- The work must be **paid** (volunteer/unpaid internships don’t count).
- At least 1 year (or 1,560 hours) of full-time (or equivalent part-time) work experience in the past 3 years.<br><br>

#### Explanation of the Eligibility of Canadian Experience Class
##### What is NOC and TEER?
The National Occupation Classification (NOC) system is used by Canada to classify occupations. The updated NOC uses **Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER)** levels.
Only TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 jobs count toward the Canadian Experience Class.

##### How to Check Your TEER Level:
1. Use the [Find your NOC tool](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/find-national-occupation-code.html) to search your job title.
2. Cross-reference the NOC code in the [official NOC website](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA) to verify job duties.
3. If it matches and falls under TEER 0–3, congratulations! You’re eligible for CEC.<br><br>

### CRS Points System and `Current Categories`
Once you’re eligible for one of the three programs, you can increase your CRS score through the following six `Current categories`:

1. French-language proficiency  
2. Healthcare and social services occupations  
3. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) occupations  
4. Trade occupations  
5. Agriculture and agri-food occupations  
6. Education occupations  

This guide focuses on the **French-language proficiency** category.

#### French-language proficiency Category Eligibility
1. <span style="color: red;">**Meet the general EE eligibility**</span>, i.e., qualify for one of the three immigration programs.
2. <span style="color: red;">**Take a French test**</span> and obtain at least **NCLC 7** in all four skills.
3. <span style="color: red;">**Satisfy additional requirements**</span> published during the draw.

## Introduction to PTE Core
Most people are familiar with English language tests like IELTS and CELPIP. Here, we introduce **PTE Core**, another English test accepted by IRCC. It is often considered easier and faster to prepare, especially for achieving **CLB 9** scores.
