# How to Apply PR via Learning French and Express Entry
This guide explains how to learn French and apply for permanent residence (PR) in Canada through Express Entry as a French beginner. We will begin with an overview of the Express Entry system, with a focus on the <span style="color: red;">**French-language proficiency**</span> category. Then we'll introduce TCF Canada, the French test accepted for immigration purposes. Finally, we will share a study plan for both TCF Canada and PTE Core to accelerate your Express Entry application.

## Overview
[TOC]

## Introduction to Express Entry System
[Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry) is the Canadian government's online system for managing skilled worker immigration. In this guide, we will use `EE Entry` to refer to the Express Entry system.

EE Entry is a point-based system with different immigration programs and selection categories. Understanding both is critical to maximizing your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. In this section, we briefly introduce the Canadian Experience Class and the French-language proficiency category. For more details, see [EE Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply.html#programs).

There are three main structural components of EE Entry:

1. <span style="color: red;">**Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)**</span>: Calculate your CRS points, which is not only used in eligibility but also used in ranking.
2. <span style="color: red;">**Immigration Programs**</span>: Determine your eligibility to enter the EE pool.
3. <span style="color: red;">**Current Categories**</span>: Award additional points in targeted rounds or encourage more applications by requiring lower points.

To begin, you must first qualify for one of the immigration programs, then explore categories to boost your score.
### Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)
CRS Points System is a key component of EE Entry. It is used to determine candidates' eligibility and rank them in the pool. Here is the [official calculator](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/check-score.html#calculator) of CRS Points System. You can try it out to see how many points you can get.

### Eligibility for EE Entry and the Three `Immigration programs`
#### Immigration Programs
According to the [official website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry), EE Entry includes three immigration programs:

1. Canadian Experience Class
2. Federal Skilled Worker Program
3. Federal Skilled Trades Program<br><br>

#### Eligibility for Immigration Programs
Each program has distinct eligibility requirements. Applicants must first identify the one they qualify for to enter the EE pool.

We'll focus on the [Canadian Experience Class](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply/canadian-experience-class.html):

1. Be in one or more NOC categories: <span style="color: red;">**TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3**</span>
    1. Your experience can be in more than one NOC.
    2. See explanation of NOC in the [Eligibility of Canadian Experience Class](#explanation-of-the-eligibility-of-canadian-experience-class) section.
2. Be <span style="color: red;">**gained in Canada**</span> while authorized to work under temporary resident status
    1. If you worked remotely, you must have been physically in Canada and working for a Canadian employer.
3. Show that you performed:
    1. The actions in the lead statement of the NOC job description
    2. Most of the main duties listed
4. Be <span style="color: red;">**paid work**</span> (you must have been paid wages or earned commission—volunteer work or unpaid internships don't count)
5. Be at least 1 year of work or 1,560 hours total (30 hours per week) in the 3 years before you apply<br><br>



#### Explanation of the Eligibility of Canadian Experience Class
##### What is NOC and TEER?
The National Occupation Classification (NOC) system is used by Canada to classify occupations. The updated NOC uses <span style="color: red;">**Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER)**</span> levels.
Only TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 jobs count toward the Canadian Experience Class.<br><br>

##### How to Check Your TEER Level?
1. Use the [Find your NOC tool](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/find-national-occupation-code.html) to search your job title.
2. Cross-reference the NOC code in the [official NOC website](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA) to verify job duties.
3. If it matches and falls under TEER 0–3, congratulations! You're eligible for CEC.<br><br>

##### Example of NOC and TEER

Take an Example of a Graduate Student in Canada, the NOC code of `Post-secondary teaching and research assistants` is `41201` with `TEER 1` level, as we can see in the [NOC Website](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA). 

And then we can see in the [Search Result of NOC Website](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/NOCProfile?code=41201&version=2021.0), Both Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants are included in TEER 1. So if you were serving as a TA or RA in Canada for at least 1 year, you are eligible for Canadian Experience Class Program.<br><br>


### `Current Categories`
#### All Current Categories
Once you're eligible for one of the three programs, you can increase your CRS score through the following six `Current categories`:

1. French-language proficiency  
2. Healthcare and social services occupations  
3. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) occupations  
4. Trade occupations  
5. Agriculture and agri-food occupations  
6. Education occupations

This guide focuses on the <span style="color: red;">**French-language proficiency**</span> category.<br><br>

#### French-language proficiency Category Eligibility
1. <span style="color: red;">**Meet the minimum criteria for Express Entry**</span>, including being eligible for 1 of the 3 immigration programs it covers
2. Have French-language test results that show a minimum score of <span style="color: red;">**7 in all 4 language abilities **</span>on the Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens
3. Meet all of the requirements in the instructions for that round

When holding a category-based round of invitations, IRCC will:

1. Rank candidates in the pool who meet the category requirements
2. Invite top-ranking candidates to apply for permanent residence

> For the most up-to-date information, refer to the [official category-based selection page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/rounds-invitations/category-based-selection.html).

## Introduction to PTE Core
Most people are familiar with English language tests like IELTS and CELPIP. Here, we introduce <span style="color: red;">**PTE Core**</span>, another English test accepted by IRCC. It is often considered easier and faster to prepare.

According to [IRCC's official document](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility/language-results.html), the PTE Core-CLB Equivalency is as follows:
