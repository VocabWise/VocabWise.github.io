## Overview

## Introduction to Express Entry System
[Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry) is an online system that we use to manage immigration applications from skilled workers. In the following contents, we will use `EE Entry` to refer to Express Entry System.

Given the fact that EE Enrty is a point-based system, with different categories and pools, it's important to know the prerequisites for each category and pool, as well as the general points for each category and pool in recent cases. We will give a brief introduction to the eligibility of French-language proficiency Category in this section, for more detailed information, please refer to [EE Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply.html#programs).

Express Entry has two types of categories with distinct functions:

1. <span style="color: red;">**Immigration Programs**</span>: Determine eligibility for different target groups
2. <span style="color: red;">**Current Categories**</span>: Provide additional points to accelerate applications

To apply, first verify your eligibility under one of the Immigration Programs, then explore Current Categories to maximize your points.

### Eligibility for EE Entry and three `Immigration programs`
Currently, according to the [Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry), there are three `Immigration programs` in EE Entry:

1. Canadian Experience Class
2. Federal Skilled Worker Program
3. Federal Skilled Trades Program

All of them have different eligibility requirements. People should choose the program that they are eligible for to get in the pool first. <br><br>

Here we are going to mainly discuss the eligibility for [Canadian Experience Class](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply/canadian-experience-class.html).

    - Your experience can be in more than 1 NOC

> #### Explanation of the Eligibility of Canadian Experience Class
> ##### Definition of National Occupation Classification (NOC)
> The National Occupational Classification (NOC) is a system used by the Canadian government to classify jobs. The NOC is used to determine the eligibility of the Canadian Experience Class. Only TEER 0, 1, 2, and 3 are eligible for the ***Canadian Experience Class***.
> 
> ##### How to Check What TEER I am in?
> 1. Go to the filter of [Find your National Occupation Code(NOC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/find-national-occupation-code.html) and then search the NOC code of your occupation. You can find some relative occupations in the result.
> 2. Search the corresponding occupations' NOC code in [NOC Website](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA), so check the destail of the corresponding occupation and double check if your occupation is exactly the same as the occupation in the NOC Website.
> 3. If you are in TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3, Congratulations! You should be or will be eligible for the ***Canadian Experience Class***.

### CRS Points System and `Current categories`
After you have already checked the `Immigration programs` and you are eligible for the program, you should check the `Current categories` to see how can you accelerate your application in EE Entry in this system. Currently, there are 6 `Current categories` in EE Entry:

1. French-language proficiency
2. Healthcare and social services occupations
3. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) occupations
4. Trade occupations
5. Agriculture and agri-food occupations
6. Education occupations

And we will only talk about the `French-language proficiency` category in this section.
